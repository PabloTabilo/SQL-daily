# New Concepts learned + some interesting references
* CTE's for SQL: https://builtin.com/data-science/advanced-sql
    -  A CTE (common table expression) is a temporary, named result set defined within an SQL query using the WITH keyword, which is used to simplify complex queries by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts.
* `HAVING` SQL, condition used for aggregate functions: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp
* `dateDiff` : difference between two days, in this case must be on days.
* `NULL`: Represents the absence of a value, this means "unknown" or "not applicable" in a database (chatgpt answer). 
* `CASE`: Implementation of CASE https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_case.asp
* `ENUM`: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/enumerator-enum-in-mysql/
    * The `ENUM` data type in MySQL is a string object that allows us to limit the value chosen from a list of permitted values in the column specification at the time of column creation.
    * `ENUM` values are stored as integers (1, 2, 3, â€¦) behind the scenes, which is more space-efficient than storing strings.
